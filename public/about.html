<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>   A recent graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology. 
  Izzy Esparza graduated Magna Cum Laude with a bachelor’s degree in Illustration and a minor in Art history. 
  Part of her success at FIT came from assisting the founding of the Illustrate New York club which she was Treasurer of. 
  Illustrate New York took advantage of New York’s artistic opportunities and provided a safe space for students to collaborate 
  while exploring all of the city’s hot spots. </p>

  <p>Being from an immigrant household, Izzy spent her entire life adapting between Mexican cultures, 
  the values of her parents at home, and the culture of the US. In a traditional Mexican household, 
  you spend a lot of time at home. As a kid, she grew up absorbing fantasy-based media like Star Wars, Stephen King novels, 
  Guillermo Del Toro films, and RPG video games. This mixed with the Mexican folklore and superstitious stories heard 
  in her parent’s hometown of Aguascalientes, Mexico. Very early, Izzy developed a wild imagination for fantasy worlds 
  and began her interest in drawing. Today, immersing herself in fantastical ideas is the way she deals with the stressors of daily life. </p>

  <p>Her artistic skill starts with traditional oil painting, digital illustration, and even extends to sculpting 
  3D works through the use of Zbrush.  Izzy looks to develop imaginary worlds and characters through creating concept art. 
  Great at portraying a dark atmosphere and mystery, she creates scenes that you could only picture in your sleep.</p>
