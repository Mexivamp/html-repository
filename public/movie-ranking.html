<h2>Here are my favorite 5 films of all time!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Shining</h3>
<p>Arguably Stanley Kubrick's BEST film, a must watch for all horror fanatics. Watch Jack Nicholson try to kill his family.</p>

<h3>Mulholland Drive</h3>
<p>A spooky lgbtq+ friendly mystery.
</p>

<h3>Pan's Labyrinth</h3>
<p>A tragic and beautiful thriller fantasy Guillermo Del Toro film. Best creature design, definitely watch if you want a good cry.</p>

<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>Ridley Scott's most famous film. Another horror staple with sci-fi elements.</p>

<h3>The Thing</h3>
<p>This film inspired among us.</p>
